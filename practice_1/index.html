        <h2 id="Biography"><strong>Biography</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cure are an English rock band formed in 1978 in Crawley, West Sussex.<br/>
            Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist,<br/>
            and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album<br/>
            was Three Imaginary Boys (1979) and this, along with several early singles, placed the band<br/>
            in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. </p>

        <p>The Cure are often identified with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed as one of the form's definitive bands.<br/>
            However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006,<br/>
            "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, "We're not categorisable. I suppose we were<br/>
            post-punk when we came out, but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is."</p>
        <h2 id="Awards and nominations"><strong>Awards and nominations</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cure have been given at least six awards, including two Brit Awards (Best British video for "Lullaby" in 1990, and Best British group in 1991),<br/>
            and a Viewer's Choice (Europe) MTV Video Music Award for "Friday I'm In Love" in 1992. Robert Smith was given an Ivor Novello Award<br/>
            for International Achievement in 2001. The Brit Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's (BPI) annual pop music awards.<br/>
            The Cure has received two awards from five nominations.</p>
