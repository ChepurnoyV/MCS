        <h2 id="BIO"><strong> BIO</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cure are an English rock band formed in 1978 in Crawley, West Sussex.
            Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist,
            and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album
            was Three Imaginary Boys (1979) and this, along with several early singles, placed the band
            in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. </p>

        <h2 id="MSTYLE"><strong> Musical style</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cure are often identified with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed as one of the form's definitive bands.
            However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006,
            "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, "We're not categorisable. I suppose we were
            post-punk when we came out, but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is."</p>

        <h2 id="AWARDS"><strong> AWARDS</strong></h2>
        <p>The Cure have been given at least six awards, including two Brit Awards (Best British video for "Lullaby" in 1990, and Best British group in 1991),
            and a Viewer's Choice (Europe) MTV Video Music Award for "Friday I'm In Love" in 1992. Robert Smith was given an Ivor Novello Award
            for International Achievement in 2001. The Brit Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's (BPI) annual pop music awards.
            The Cure has received two awards from five nominations.</p>
